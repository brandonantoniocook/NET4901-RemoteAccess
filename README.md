# NET4901-RemoteAccess
## Developing an in-house remote access solution to access real equipment

Description: The main goal of this project is to develop a working solution for being able to remotely access
routers and switches through an online portal. The following steps are examples of the work that
will have to be done.

- Familiarize yourself with the concept of remote access solutions.
- Familiarize yourself with the various pieces of equipment that you will have to deal with such as switches,
  routers, servers,    access servers, control switch, switched PDUs, CAB-OCTAL-ASYNC cables, etc.
- Develop a basic online tool such that a single piece of equipment can be accessed.
- Expand the capabilities of the tool to deal with simple pre-defined network topologies.
- Add other features as will be discussed throughout the evolution of this project.

Although the main steps listed above will have to be done, there is a lot of room for creativity as to how these
steps will be achieved and what features will be added. Overall, this project requires students with good
knowledge of networking, programming, scripting and software development.

A similar commercial example of such a remote access solution is called Netlab. You can see more information
